Very simple python app, mainly just to fix my boredom

IMPORTANT:
To set the app up initally, you have to go into the variables.txt file and follow the instructions to tell the app where the paths for the applications are, I'm hoping to fix this in the future with a new language or a workaround on python but this current state is just to pave the way.

CURRENTLY SUPPORTED APPS:
Volanta
Navigraph Charts
MSFS (obviously)
