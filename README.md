Very simple python app, mainly just to fix my boredom

IMPORTANT:
To set the app up initally, you have to go into the variables.txt file to tell the app where the paths (make sure to paste the entire path, eg. drivepath:folder/app/app.exe)
to tell the app where the applications are, I'm hoping to fix this in the future with a new language or a workaround on python but this current state is just to pave the way.

CURRENTLY SUPPORTED APPS (more to be supported along the way or if some people ask for it) :
Volanta
Navigraph Charts
MSFS (obviously)
